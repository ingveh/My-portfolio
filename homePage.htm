            <h3>Education</h3>

            <p>
                I attended primary school and secondary school in my hometown Sandnes.
                The schools I attended were Austrått skole and Høyland ungdomsskole
                respectively. Here I began learning French and was particularly fond
                of mathematics and natural sciences. I even participated in a group
                for pupils with strong mathematical skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                After secondary school I continued on to Stavanger katedralskole, an
                upper secondary school in Stavanger. Here I continued learning French,
                pursued the science subjects mathematics, physics and chemistry, and
                most importantly I attended the school via a programme for pupils
                which were both skilled and had an above average interest in science.
                This meant that during my attendance at the school, I took additional
                subjects such as extra mathematics and Python programming. I also
                competed in a competition issued by the Norwegian University of
                Science and Technology (NTNU) where we measured and analysed 
                environmental conditions around a lake using a self made sensor
                package. Lastly, during my last year at Stavanger Katedralskole I had
                opportunity to take a university level physics course in mechanics at
                the University of Stavanger (UiS) in parallel with my normal subjects.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next I went on to study for a bachelor's degree in Physics at NTNU.
                I have currently finished three years of the degree and have written a
                thesis on how an electron behaves quantum mechanically in a system
                of interest. The subject I have enjoyed the most is quantum mechanics,
                and in addition to my physics subjects I immensely enjoy mathematics
                and programming. I have learned and used Python programming a lot
                for projects and laboratory work during my degree, and it is thus
                my main programming language. However, I am planning on attending a
                course in C++ programminng, and I am currently teaching myself web 
                design using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
